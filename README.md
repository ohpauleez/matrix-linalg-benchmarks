# Matrix and Linear Algebra benchmarks

A quick project to bench matrix multiplication across
various Java and Clojure matrix libraries.

**THIS IS A VERY BAD BENCHMARK** - it doesn't factor in real world scenarios,
and ignores the impact of ecosystem.  this is a micro-benchmark about the
speed of a common individual matrix operation

## Usage
